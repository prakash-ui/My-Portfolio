        I'm a passionate Full-Stack MERN Developer with hands-on experience building fast, scalable, and user-friendly web applications using React, Vite.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I specialize in API development, cloud integration, and building seamless user experiences.

From crafting responsive frontends to architecting robust backends, I thrive in turning ideas into fully functional digital products. I'm also experienced with modern BaaS platforms like Firebase, Appwrite, and Supabase, allowing me to ship projects faster without compromising scalability or security.

Whether it's building real-time features, deploying serverless architectures, or optimizing for performance, I enjoy solving problems and continuously improving as a developer..
